# 📈 Stock Price Trend Prediction with LSTM

This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict Tesla (TSLA) stock prices based on historical data.

## 🧠 Objective
Predict future stock prices using past trends with deep learning.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Keras (with TensorFlow backend)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- yfinance (optional)
- Streamlit (optional for dashboard)

## 📁 Files
- `TSLA_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned dataset used for training
- `lstm_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with full code
- `tsla_lstm_model.h5`: Trained LSTM model weights
- `README.md`: Project overview (this file)

## 🔄 Steps
1. Load and preprocess stock price data
2. Normalize data using MinMaxScaler
3. Create time-series sequences for LSTM
4. Build and train LSTM model
5. Predict and visualize results
6. (Optional) Add technical indicators like Moving Average and RSI
7. (Optional) Deploy with Streamlit

## 📊 Output
- Graph: Actual vs. Predicted prices
- RMSE evaluation metric

## ✅ Status
Project completed ✅  
Ready for submission and presentation.
